E-commerce API:
This project is a fully functional E-commerce Product API built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). The API allows users to manage products, perform CRUD operations, manage user authentication, and handle advanced features like product reviews, wishlists, and order systems. Itâ€™s designed for e-commerce applications where products can be searched, categorized, reviewed, and purchased.


Features
1. Product Management (CRUD)
Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for products.
Each product has fields like name, description, price, category, stock quantity, image URLs, and created date.
Stock management: Stock quantity is reduced when an order is placed.
Supports multiple product images.
2. User Management (CRUD)
User registration, login, and logout with JWT authentication.
Users can perform product-related actions if authenticated (manage products, reviews, and orders).
Supports password hashing and secure authentication.
3. Product Search and Filtering
Search products by name, category, and partial matches.
Pagination support for large product listings.
Filter products by category, price range, and stock availability.
4. Product Reviews
Authenticated users can submit reviews for products.
Retrieve all reviews for a product.
5. Wishlists
Authenticated users can add products to their wishlist.
Endpoints to view, add, and remove products from a wishlist.
6. Order System
Users can place orders for products.
Automatic stock management when an order is placed or marked as reserved.
7. Authentication with JWT
Token-based authentication using Simple JWT.
Access token and refresh token management.
Token expiration and refresh functionality.
8. Admin Panel
Full control over products, categories, users, orders, and reviews from the Django admin panel.
Admins can manage the stock, update product details, and handle user permissions.
9. Deployment
Ready to be deployed on platforms like Heroku or PythonAnywhere.

Set appropriate JWT token lifetimes:

SIMPLE_JWT = {
    'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(minutes=15),
    'REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=7),
}
