Supports password hashing and secure authentication.
3. Product Search and Filtering
Search products by name, category, and partial matches.
Pagination support for large product listings.
Filter products by category, price range, and stock availability.
4. Product Reviews
Authenticated users can submit reviews for products.
Retrieve all reviews for a product.
5. Wishlists

Endpoints to view, add, and remove products from a wishlist.
6. Order System
Users can place orders for products.
Automatic stock management when an order is placed or marked as reserved.
7. Authentication with JWT
Token-based authentication using Simple JWT.
Access token and refresh token management.
Token expiration and refresh functionality.
8. Admin Panel
Full control over products, categories, users, orders, and reviews from the Django admin panel.
Admins can manage the stock, update product details, and handle user permissions.
9. Deployment
Ready to be deployed on platforms like Heroku or PythonAnywhere.

## Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Django 4.x
Django REST Framework
PostgreSQL or MySQL (or SQLite for development)
Docker (Optional for containerization)

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eeyueltesfaye/Alx_Capstone_Project.git
   cd Ecommerce_Api
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Set up environment variable**:
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following keys:

 ```bash
  SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>
   ```
6. **Run migrations**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
 7. **Create a superuser for accessing the admin panel**:

 ```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. **Run the development server** 

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**: Set up the required environment variables, such as `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, and database settings.
2. **Settings**: Update the `settings.py` file to configure installed apps, middleware, and authentication backends as necessary.

## Usage

1. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Access the API**: Open a web browser or an API client (like Postman) and navigate to:

   ```web
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/
   ```

3. **URL Roots**

**register**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/register/` # User registration

**login**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/login/` # User login

**logout**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/logout/` # User logout - Use refresh token

**users**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/` # View all users - Authentication required

**products**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/` # View all products - Authentication required

**orders**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/orders/list/` # View orders

**Token**`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/refresh/` # Generate JWT token

## Additional Features

### Security Recommendations:
- Set DEBUG=False in production.
- Use a secure and random SECRET_KEY.
- Ensure database credentials are stored securely.
- Set appropriate JWT token lifetimes:
